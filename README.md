# Litteri

A poor man's WEBVTT editor, aimed primarily at editing transliterations generated by automatic tools (e.g. [OpenAPI Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper)).

To start, install npm/pnpm, clone, `npm i` and `npm run dev`.

You can also use web version (all your videos/audios and subtitles are stored locally, not on a server): https://litteri.deni.sh

## Quick use

TODO: Write proper guide.

The webpage is meant to be used with keyboard only. Once you load in the subtitle file, focus on the first cue. After that, use the following keys:

* Tab: Move to the next cue. If video/audio is loaded, it will automatically jump to that place.
* Shift + Tab: Move to the previous cue. Video/audio position is updated as well.
* Ctrl + Space: Pause/Unpause the video/audio.
* Ctrl + Shift + Space: Rewind the video/audio to the start of the currently focused cue.
* Number keys (on keypad): Set the actor number on the current cue. These are used when exporting to an interview summary.
* Keypad 0: Remove the actor number on the current cue.
* Keypad minus: Mark the cue as "miscellaneous". These cues won't be exported into the interview.
